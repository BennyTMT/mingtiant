I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tom Hartvigsen](https://www.tomhartvigsen.com/home) and [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). My research focuses on LLM agents and post-training, with a particular emphasis on time-series tasks. Previously, I studied at Fudan University, where I worked with [Prof. Zhe Zhou](https://www.y-droid.com/zhe/) on machine learning security and side-channel attacks.

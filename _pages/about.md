I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tom Hartvigsen](https://www.tomhartvigsen.com/home) and [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Tim Althoff](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~althoff/).

My research focuses on LLM agents and post-training, with a particular emphasis on time-series forecasting and reasoning tasks. Previously, I studied at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), where I worked with [Prof. Zhe Zhou](https://www.y-droid.com/zhe/) on Machine Learning Security and Side-Channel Informations. 

I am also a Student Researcher at Google<img src="{{ '/assets/img/google.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Google" style="height: 18px; vertical-align: -3px; margin-left: 6px;">, working on agent-related projects now.
